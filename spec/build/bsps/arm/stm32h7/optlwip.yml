description: |
  This flag allows lwIP to work properly based on the STM32 lwIP example.
  The user must take care of the following steps in the application:
   1. The lwIP DMA descriptors have to be placed into the .bsp_no_cache section instead
      of custom sections.
   2. The sections need to be aligned to 32 bytes (0x20) boundaries.
  This can be achieved by appending
    __attribute__((section(.bsp_no_cache),__aligned__(0x20)));
  to the descriptor definitions.
